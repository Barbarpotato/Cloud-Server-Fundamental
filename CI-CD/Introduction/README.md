# Introduction to CI/CD
- Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are two separate and distinct processes that occur sequentially.
    - CI is an automation process that developers continuously use to integrate code into the main branch.
    - CD automatically deploys this integrated code similar to a staging, testing, or preproduction server.

- CI consists of the Plan, Code, Build, and Test phases.

- CD consists of the Release, Deploy, and Operate phases.
    - It’s acceptable for different teams within an organization to use different tools for CI/CD. What’s important is that the processes are automated.

- You can choose the CI/CD tool that works best for you.

    - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools can dramatically speed up the provisioning and managing of your development environment’s infrastructure.

- You can choose from a wide array of IaC tools.
