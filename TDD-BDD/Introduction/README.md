# Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

- Testing verifies that your software will work as expected when you or others use it. 
- Testing prevents future code breaks and compatibility issues. 
- Testing reduces overall development time. 
- The software testing process includes four levels: unit, integration, system, and acceptance. 
- The level of testing that developers perform varies throughout the phases of the traditional release cycle.
- Test cases drive code design in both behavior driven development (BDD) and test driven development (TDD). 
- BDD focuses on the system from the outside in, while TDD focuses on the system from the inside out.
- Developers use BDD for integration and acceptance testing but use TDD for unit testing. 
- Test cases help developers identify and fix parts of their code that can break.
