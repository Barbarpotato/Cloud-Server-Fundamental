# Exercise: Creating a Pipeline
In this exercise, you will first start by using AWS CodePipeline to create a new pipeline. You will create a new feature branch in your repository and edit some application code. You will then commit the changes to your feature branch and merge the feature branch into your main branch.

## Task 1: Creating a pipeline
In this task, you use AWS CodePipeline to create a pipeline.
1. In the console, choose Services, and search for and select CodePipeline.
2. Choose Create pipeline.
3. For Pipeline name, enter trivia-pipeline and choose Next.
4. In the Add source stage step, configure the following settings:
   -    Source provider: AWS CodeCommit
   -    Repository name: trivia-app
   -    Branch name: main

5. Choose Next.
6. In the Add build stage step, configure the following settings.
    -   Build provider: AWS CodeBuild
    -   Project name: trivia-unittests

7. Choose Next.

8. In the Add deploy stage step, choose Skip deploy stage and then choose Skip.

9. In the Review step, choose Create pipeline. You should see a Success message.

## Task 2: Creating a feature branch

In this task, you create a new feature branch in your AWS CodeCommit repository.
1. In a separate browser tab, switch to the AWS Cloud9 development environment. Make sure that you are in the trivia-app directory.
    ```
    cd ~/environment/trivia-app
    ```
2. You should see that you created a new branch and switched to that branch:
    ```
    Switched to a new branch 'feature-bonus-scores'
    ```

## Task 3: Editing the code
In this task, you edit the code to implement a bonus scores feature.

1. Open the trivia-app/back-end-python/gameactions/app.py file.
2. In the trivia_calculate_scores function, locate the code where last_answer is set.
3. On the next line, add code to set the bonus variable:
    ```
    last_answer = connection["lastAnswer"] if "lastAnswer" in connection else ""
    bonus = question["bonus"] if "bonus" in question else 0
    ```
4. You also need to add the bonus variable to the calculation logic. Update the code incrementing score so that it includes bonus.
    ```
    if last_question_id == question["id"] and last_answer == question["answer"]:
        score += 20 + bonus
    ```
5. Save the file.

6. You also need to update the unit tests code so that it tests the new bonus score. Open the trivia-app/back-end-python/tests/unit/test_handler.py file.

7. Replace SCORES_EVENT with a new event that includes a bonus score:
    ```
    SCORES_EVENT = {
        "gameid" : "01234567012301230123012345678901",
        "questions" : [
            { "id" : "q-1111", "question" : "Good question?", "answer" : "Yes", "bonus": 20},
        ],
        "iterator" : { "questionpos" : 0 }
    }
    ```
8. Find the test_trivia_calculate_scores_correct section and change the assert statements to expect a score of 40.
    ```
    app.TABLE.update_item.assert_called_with(
        Key={'gameId': '01234567012301230123012345678901', 'connectionId': 'connection-1'},
        AttributeUpdates={'score': {'Value': 40, 'Action': 'PUT'}}
    )

    app.MANAGEMENT.post_to_connection.assert_has_calls([
        mock.call(Data='{"action": "playerlist", "players": [{"connectionId": "connection-1", "playerName": "AliceBlue", "score": 40, "currentPlayer": true}]}', ConnectionId='connection-1'),
        mock.call(Data='{"action": "gameover"}', ConnectionId='connection-1')
        ])
    ```
9. Save the file.
10. Verify that the code is stable by running the unit test.

## Task 4: Committing and merging the new code

In this final task, you commit the new code to your feature branch in AWS CodeCommit. You then merge the changes into the main branch.

1. In the AWS Cloud9 terminal, view the status of your git repository by running the following command:
    ```
    git status
    ```
    You should see that status of the two files changed to not staged for commit.
2. Add the files, create a commit, and push the changes to the origin remote.
    ```
    git add *
    git commit -m "new bonus score feature"
    git push origin feature-bonus-scores
    ```
    As of now, you havenâ€™t made any changes to the main branch yet.
3. Switch back to the CodePipeline tab.
4. Choose Services and then select CodeCommit.
5. In CodeCommit, open the trivia-app repository and in the navigation pane, choose Commits.
6. On the right, view the bonus score commit by opening the dropdown menu with main and selecting feature-bonus-scores.
7. At the top of the window, choose the trivia-app breadcrumb.
8. Choose Create pull request.
9. For Destination, keep main selected and for Source, choose feature-bonus-scores.
10. Choose Compare. You can scroll down to see the code changes that you made.
11. In Details > Title, enter New feature: Bonus scoring. Choose Create pull request.
12. Choose Merge.
13. Keep both Fast forward merge and Delete source branch feature-bonus-scores after merging? selected. Choose Merge pull request.
14. In the navigation pane, see the new merge commit by choosing Commits.
15. In the navigation pane, open the CodePipeline console by choosing Pipeline > Pipelines.
16. View the pipeline details by opening trivia-pipeline. In the Source section, you should see the new commit: Source: new bonus score feature
17. Review the Build section. The recently merged commit on the main branch triggered a pipeline build.

18. Switch back to the AWS Cloud9 tab.
19. The new features you committed have been merged to main. Update the main branch locally by running the following commands:
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git log
    ```
    In the Git log, you should see the new bonus score feature commit.
