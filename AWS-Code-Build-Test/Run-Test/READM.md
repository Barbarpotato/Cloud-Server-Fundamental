# Exercise: Testing the Application
In this exercise, you will return to the AWS Cloud9 instance and run the local build for the project. The local build contains linting (or static analysis) of the code and unit tests. Next, you will run an integration test. The integration test finds the API Gateway Websocket endpoint, and it simulates a player completing a game. You will then add a simple feature to the code. Finally, you will fix the unit tests and commit the changes to your repository.


## Task 1: Running unit tests
In this task, you run unit tests against the application code. You then view the reports that are outputted from these tests.
1. In your AWS Cloud9 terminal, make sure you are still in the trivia-app folder. The prompt should also show the top-level Git branch.
    ```
    cd ~/environment/trivia-app
    ```
2. Install the backend code requirements and the unit test requirements by using pip3 to run the following commands.
    ```
    pip3 install -U -r back-end-python/gameactions/requirements.txt
    pip3 install -U -r back-end-python/tests/requirements.txt
    ./local_build.sh
    ```
    You should see the code rating after pylint does its static analysis:
    ```
    ------------------------------------
    Your code has been rated at 10.00/10
    ```
    Then, pytest runs its unit tests, which are shown like the following example:
    ```
    back-end-python/tests/unit/test_handler.py .........
    ```
    It will also output a coverage report in HTML, which is in /trivia-app/htmlcov.
3. In the htmlcov folder, right-click the index.html file and view the coverage report by choosing Preview.

## Task 2: Running the integration test
For this task, you run an integration test against the application code.

1. Start the integration test (which will simulate a game) by running the following command.
    ```
    AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME=trivia-app pytest -s back-end-python/tests/integration/test_api_gateway.py
    ```
    The integration test uses the AWS SAM stack to find the Websocket endpoint, so the stack is passed in the AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME environment variable.
    At the end of the test, you should see the following message: 1 passed

## Task 3: Updating the code and unit tests
In this task, you update the application code to change the score value from 10 to 20. You also update the unit test code.
1. Open the trivia-app/back-end-python/gameactions/app.py file.
2. Scroll down to the trivia_calculate_scores function.
3. Update the code so the game increments the score by 20 instead of by 10. Locate score += 10 and change it to score += 20. Make sure to save the file.
    ```
    score += 20
    ```
4. Verify that you left the code in a stable state by running the ``./local_build.sh` command.
    At the top of the failure report, you should see that the test_trivia_calculate_scores_correct test failed:

    You also need to update the unit test to match the new score.

5. Open the trivia-app/back-end-python/tests/unit/test_handler.py file.

6. Find the test_trivia_calculate_scores_correct function.

7. In the functionâ€™s TABLE.update_item.assert_called_with call, find the AttributeUpdates field and update the Value from 10 to 20.
    ```
    AttributeUpdates={'score': {'Value': 20, 'Action': 'PUT'}}
    ```
8. You must also update app.MANAGEMENT.post_to_connection.assert_has_calls (which tests API Gateway Websocket calls). Change the value of score from 10 to 20.
    ```
    mock.call(Data='{"action": "playerlist", "players": [{"connectionId": "connection-1", "playerName": "AliceBlue", "score": 20, "currentPlayer": true}]}', ConnectionId='connection-1'),
    ```
9. ave the file and re-run ./local_build.sh. The test summary should again show that everything passed.

## Task 4: Committing to source control through the AWS CLI
1. In AWS Cloud9, you can also use the AWS CLI to commit the changes to AWS CodeCommit by running the following command:
    ```
    git add *
    git commit -m "Scores now increment by 20"
    git push origin main
    ```
